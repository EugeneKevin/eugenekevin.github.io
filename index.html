	    			Some Thoughts about PickPad. And some rumors.
	    		</p>
	    	</div>
	    	<div class="text">
	    		<p>
	    			While building this concept, I spent a lot of time thinking about how to make the move of the thumb from the screen to the Home Button meaningful: if one has to do such a long move with their finger, then it has to be in order to do something more than just quitting an app. The whole idea relies on trying to find the perfect balance between the actions made with the fingers on the screen and those made with the thumb on the PickPad. One has to think indeed about how to minimize the number of travels between the display and the PickPad so as for it be really productivity-oriented.
	    		</p>
	    		<p>
	    			I still believe that the Home Button needs to be physical. There have been several rumors that go in the sense of its integration to the screen itself in future iterations of the iPhone. Yet, having a fully digital Home Button may lead to numerous unwanted manipulation errors when holding the phone. One must feel the Home Button without even having to look at it. But again, it depends on how it is done.
	    		</p>
	    		<p>
	    			Now that you start to feel what PickPad is, let us dig deeper into the rich possibilities of interaction it enables. It all starts right from the beginning : the Lock Screen.
	    		</p>
	    	</div>

	    		The Lock Screen
	    	</div>
			<div class="text">
				<p>
					With the release of iOS 10, Apple has dramatically changed the way the Lock Screen works. By a fortunate coincidence, they made it similar to what I am going to propose you now. 
				</p>
				<p>
					The idea is the following : why should we bother unlocking the iPhone when most of the tasks could be done directly from the Lock Screen ? If I have several notifications displayed on the Lock Screen, I want to be able to react right away.
				</p>
				<p>
					In fact, this very idea led to the concept of PickPad. Indeed, if we want to have some interaction with the Lock Screen, then the user needs to be autentified. But the rich possibilities enabled by 3D Touch, such as Peek and Pop, would not be possible given that the screen is not able to identify the user (yet… although it may not be desirable. See above « Some thoughts about PickPad »). But there is an authentification tool on the iPhone, right under the screen, and it is called Touch Id.
				</p>
				<p>
					Combining the possibilities of Touch Id (especially now that it is faster than ever) with a Home Button sensitive to pression and direction is a possible solution. This is, essentially, how PickPad was born.
				</p>
				<p>
					Let us see how it works.

							<span class="semibold">Turning on the iPhone. </span>With PickPad, turning on the iPhone becomes a whole different experience. Simply put your finger on the home button and leave it there. Pick will activate itself and allow you to pick a notification, directly from the Home button. Each time you will select a notification, you will feel a subtle tap directly under the thumb. And if there’s no notification, the iPhone will take you 	directly to the Springboard.

	    		<p>
	    			The concept of cards lies at the core of iOS Fuji. This is where PickPad and its integration into the iOS UI-UX takes its whole meaning. By trying to find the perfect balance between the actions made onscreen and those made using the PickPad, one makes sure that the user experience is as smooth as can be.   
	    		</p>
	    		<p>
	    			With the concept of cards, I propose an alternative handling of apps on a smartphone, one that is productivity-oriented, that is, the capability of doing many things in a short period of time. Some say that smartphone screens should be split in two or more so that users may be able to simultaneously complete several tasks. However, on such a small screen, I hardly see how this can truly be efficient. We cannot simply see smartphones as small computers (although, from a technical point of view, it is undoubtedly the case). Smartphones and computers are two worlds apart in the sense that the user experience truly differs from one type of device to another. Moreover, we do not use smartphones and computers for the same purpose. A designer must definitely take into account these facts when designing new interfaces or experiences. 
	    		</p>
	    		<p>
	    			Cards are alternate versions of apps that do not fill the whole screen and are quickly interchangeable.
	    		</p>
	    		<p>
	    			Let us see how this works in details.

						With iOS 10, Siri is now open to developers. As the number of functionalities will continue growing, it is expected that people will start to use it more and more. Therefore, we need to rethink the way Siri works in order to support this growth.
					</p>
					<p>
						Siri should act as a true assistant, that is, it should help users fulfill their tasks much more easily were they not using it. In other words, Siri should be able to work alongside the user’s actions, not try to replace them.

				<p>
					First of all, as you may have noticed, in iOS Fuji, long pressing the Home Button does not summon Siri anymore (it opens the Cards Browser instead). Calling a vocal assistant should be done vocally solely.
				</p>
				<p>
					In iOS Fuji, we can ask Siri to prepare specific cards so that they may be instantly available to the user. For instance, say that I want to write a message to Arthur, and that my iPhone is laid on the bed out of reach, turned off. I only need to say « Hey Siri, I want to send a message to Arthur » for Siri to prepare the dedicated card for me to indeed write the message once I have my phone in the hands. Combined with the « raise to wake » functionality introduced in iOS 10, this truly is an elegant and handful feature. (i.e. Siri confirms vocally and thanks to a little jingle that the card is ready to be used. The card is displayed onscreen only when one takes the phone.)

						When listening to music, there are three gestures currently available : one click means play/pause, two clicks means playing the next song, and three clicks means playing the previous song. In iOS Fuji, in order to prevent manipulation errors that very often happen (for instance, if the beginning of a song is soft, one can hardly know whether it is actually the next song playing or if it’s the music that stopped), each of these three gestures comes along with a jingle that lets the user know how the gesture was interpreted by the OS. One click - one note jingle. Two clicks - two notes jingle. And three clicks - three notes jingle. And if you long press the button, Siri tells you what music you are currently listening to.

							The reminders become intelligent. If iOS Fuji detects that a task has been done, such as sending an email to someone, it will ask you if the task has indeed been fulfilled, so that you validate it without opening the Reminders app.

							If you watch a video on the Internet, and quit Safari by tapping the PickPad or turn off the iPhone, the video continues by default playing in the background. And while it is playing, by pressing hard on the Safari icon, you can keep an eye on it, or choose among the quick actions available.

							If some task is being done in the background, like a conversation with someone, or a video playing in Safari, a small bubble appears below the corresponding app icon. If you press hard on the icon, the widget will show you what is currently happening within the app. This is what I call Informative Design.

					iOS Fuji is a concept entirely made by me. I made it for fun with passion and love, because I wanted to share with the world some of my ideas. No commercial purposes are intended. This website is a tribute to Apple's famous designs, and should not be seen as a counterfeit or a pale imitation. Making something new while respecting Apple's aesthetics codes, for the website as well for the concept itself, was really challenging. iOS, iPhone, macOS, Mac, Continuity, 3D Touch, etc. are trademarks that belong to Apple. Thanks to Simon Mettler, Pham Thi Dieu Linh, David Pareja, Zachary Bogard, Akshay Kore, Marie Van den Broeck, Marcio Duarte, and Marek Polavic for the icons they designed and that I used for the purpose of this website. And also, many thanks to the designers of sketchappsources.com for building graphical resources from the iOS GUI that I used and built upon for my concept. The sketches have been designed using Sketch.
